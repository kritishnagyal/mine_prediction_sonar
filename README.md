# 🎯 Sonar Signal Classification – Mine vs. Rock

This project involves building a **Supervised Machine Learning model** to classify sonar signals as either reflecting off a **mine** or a **rock**. The classification is based on the analysis of the signal's frequency components using data from a submarine sonar system.

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Dataset Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
**Instances**: 208  
**Features**: 60 numerical features  
**Target**: Binary classification –  
- **R**: Rock  
- **M**: Mine  

### Sample:

| F1   | F2   | F3   | ... | F60  | Label |
|------|------|------|-----|------|-------|
| 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.04 | ... | 0.12 | R     |
| 0.07 | 0.10 | 0.03 | ... | 0.07 | M     |

Each feature represents the energy of a sonar signal in a specific frequency band. The label indicates whether the sonar echo bounced off a rock or a mine.

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a binary classifier that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a **rock** or a **mine**, based on the analysis of sonar signal attributes.

## ⚙️ Model Used

### Logistic Regression

This algorithm is used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

Other algorithms like KNN, SVM, or Decision Trees can also be tried.

## 📈 Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~85–90% on the test dataset.
- **Precision/Recall/F1-score**: Provided in the classification report within the notebook.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Used for error analysis.
